# Predicting-Cardiac-Arryhmia-using-ANN

The use-case data set consisted of a dataset with 279 features and total training samples which were 451 in number.
As, the number of features were >> number of samples, I used Principal Component Analysis to extract 100 features and trained an ANN with 2 layers of 100 neuron each and 1 output layers with softmax activation.

The test set accuracy is 94.63%

NOTE: The missing values were imputed using mean
